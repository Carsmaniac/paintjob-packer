[InGamePaintJobInfo]
InGamePaintJobInfoPanelName=In-Game Paint Job Info
InGameName=Paint job name
InGameNameHelp1=The name of your paint job as it appears in-game in the vehicle purchase/upgrade screen
InGameNameExample=e.g. Transit Co
InGamePrice=Price
InGamePriceHelp1=How much your paint job costs in-game, in {currency}
InGamePriceExample=e.g. 6000
InGameDefault=Unlocked by default
InGameDefaultHelp1=Whether or not your paint job can be bought from level 0, such as on a brand new profile
InGameUnlock=Unlock level
InGameUnlockHelp1=If not unlocked by default, what level your paint job is made purchasable at
InGameUnlockExample=e.g. 11

[InternalInfo]
InternalInfoPanelName=Internal (Hidden) Info and Other Settings
InternalName=Internal name
InternalNameHelp1=A unique name used by the game to identify your paint job. Mod users will NOT see this name.
InternalNameHelp2=Must be {name_length} characters or fewer, and only contain letters, numbers and underscores.
InternalNameHelp3=Must also be unique, if two different mods use the same internal name they will be incompatible with each other.
InternalNameExample=e.g. transit_co
InternalSupported=Supported cabins
InternalSupportedLargest=Largest cabin only
InternalSupportedAll=All cabins
InternalSupportedHelp1=Whether your paint job supports only the largest cabin for each truck, or all cabins.
InternalSupportedHelp2=Note that the 8x4 chassis uses a separate cabin in some cases, which would not be supported if you choose largest cabin only.
InternalSupportedExample=e.g. If you're making a paint job for the Scania S, a "largest cabin only" paint job would only support the High Roof Cabin, whereas an "all cabins" paint job would support the Normal Roof and High Roof cabins, as well as the separate High Roof 8x4 cabin.
InternalHandling=Cabin handling
InternalHandlingCombined=Combined paint job
InternalHandlingSeparate=Separate paint jobs
InternalHandlingHelp1=Whether multiple cabins should be combined into a single paint job, or separated into multiple paint jobs.
InternalHandlingHelp2=A single combined paint job requires less work and results in a smaller mod size, as you only need to make a single cabin texture for each truck. However, your design might not work across all the different cabin sizes, for example your design could look correct on large cabins, but be positioned incorrectly/stretched/cut off on smaller cabins.
InternalHandlingHelp3=Separate paint jobs allow you to tweak your design to work for each cabin, but require more work and result in a larger mod size, as you need to make separate textures for every cabin whether they need them or not.

If selected, all .dds files will be the appropriate templates (4k for trucks, 4k/2k for trailers) instead of empty images. Note that some parts on certain vehicles will still use empty images, as they have no paint job potential besides changing their colour.

ErrorIncompatibleTitle=Incompatible vehicles
ErrorIncompatible=The following vehicles are incompatible with each other:
ErrorBus1=Because of limitations of the game, bus mods use a workaround in order for paint jobs to appear on their doors. This means that paint job mods work a little strangely, and will not affect the vehicles' doors.
ErrorBus2=Any paint jobs generated by Paint Job Packer for bus mods will have a colour picker, which will allow you to change the colour of the doors, however you'll be unable to apply patterns/logos/text/etc to them.
ErrorBus3=In order to make a paint job for a bus mod that works properly, try replacing the texture files of an existing paint job, instead of making a brand new one. If you choose to continue, expect some weirdness with your mod, and note that it cannot be fixed.
ErrorBusSingle=This will affect the following vehicle:
ErrorBusMultiple=This will affect the following vehicles that you've selected:
